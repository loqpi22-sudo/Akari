# Akari
Akari is a fixed wing, high wing autonomous UAV that has been designed with a clear focus on stability, efficiency, and practical real world performance. The aircraft uses the SD7037 airfoil, which was selected after detailed analysis because it provides high lift with moderate drag, allowing Akari to fly safely at low speeds while still maintaining efficient cruise performance. This makes it well suited for smooth takeoff, controlled flight, and carrying useful payloads without compromising stability. The high wing configuration further enhances inherent stability and makes the aircraft forgiving in flight, especially during low speed operations and belly landings, which are important for reliable field operations.

Structurally, Akari follows a well balanced material strategy to achieve a strong yet lightweight airframe. An aluminium internal frame acts as the main load carrying spine, transferring forces from the wings to the fuselage and tail, while also supporting the payload and electronics. The wings use lightweight balsa ribs to maintain the airfoil shape without adding unnecessary mass, aeroply is used in areas requiring stiffness such as the fuselage shell, motor mounts, and tail surfaces, and birch reinforces high stress and high wear regions to improve durability under vibration and landing loads. This combination ensures that the airframe remains flexible enough to absorb shocks while still being rigid where strength is critical.

For propulsion and control, Akari is powered by a BLDC motor driven by a 3S LiPo battery and matched with an appropriate ESC and propeller to deliver reliable thrust and good efficiency. The aircraft is intended to operate autonomously using ArduPilot, enabling stabilised flight, waypoint navigation, and mission based control. Overall, Akari represents a thoughtfully engineered UAV where aerodynamics, structures, and autonomy come together in a practical and reliable design, making it suitable for autonomous fixed wing missions with consistent and predictable performance.
